# striver-tracker-react-app
A React app to track Striver SDE Sheet progress. My personal project to apply web development skills in real-time.

# Striver Tracker – React Project

This is a personal productivity app I'm building to track and manage progress through the **Striver SDE Sheet (191 DSA Problems)**.  
It’s my capstone project built while learning **React**, and later may include **Firebase** for persistence.
